# LinkTailor
Like a wardrobe full of clothes, LinkTailor is a virtual space where you can place applications, files, and websites â€“ treating them as garments that you can style, tag, and organize into outfits for any occasion. By saving layouts of links within LinkTailor, you can easily access them all in one place or even open them all with a single click.
